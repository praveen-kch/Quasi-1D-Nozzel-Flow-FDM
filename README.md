# Quasi-1D-Nozzel-Flow-FDM
This repository contains the java class definitions and a jar file
The classes all together implement the numerical solution of quasi one dimensional nozzel flows given in the book "Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with application" by John D. Anderson, Jr

Please refer chapter 7 in that reference book

Running the JAR file would initiate a GUI that helps in pre and post processing of the simulation.
